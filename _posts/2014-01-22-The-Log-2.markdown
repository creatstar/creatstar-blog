###Part Two: Data Integration

Let me first say what I mean by "data integration" and why I think it's important, then we'll see how it relates back to logs.

* Data integration is making all the data an organization has available in all its services and systems.

This phrase "data integration" isn't all that common, but I don't know a better one. The more recognizable term ETL usually covers only a limited part of data integration—populating a relational data warehouse. But much of what I am describing can be thought of as ETL generalized to cover real-time systems and processing flows.
>ETL通常只包含Data integration的部分，即，数据进入一个关系型数据仓库。但作者所说的Data integration概念指的是ETL概念泛化到实时系统和数据处理流。

You don't hear much about data integration in all the breathless interest and hype around the idea of big data, but nonetheless, I believe this mundane problem of "making the data available" is one of the more valuable things an organization can focus on.

Effective use of data follows a kind of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. The base of the pyramid involves capturing all the relevant data, being able to put it together in an applicable processing environment (be that a fancy real-time query system or just text files and python scripts). This data needs to be modeled in a uniform way to make it easy to read and process. Once these basic needs of capturing data in a uniform way are taken care of it is reasonable to work on infrastructure to process this data in various ways—MapReduce, real-time query systems, etc.
>类比马斯洛的需求理论，把所有的相关数据都放在一起，并统一它们的格式以便读取和处理，是有效利用数据的最基础的需求。
